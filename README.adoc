------------------

A demonstration of Pinecone using LangChain4J.

Things I need
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A Pinecone account
* A Pinecone API key
* A MongoDB account
* A MongoDB URI and two MongoDB collections
** Categories

Loading Data from the Pinecone QuickStart Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The unstructured text is initially placed in the UnstructeredText class in the text package. When more data is added to it, run the following tasks:

 - store
 - delete
 - create
 - load

The store task deletes all the content from the collections in MongoDB and reloads them with the unstructured text in the above-mentioned class.

The delete task deletes the index from Pinecone.

The create task creates the index in Pinecone.

The load task loads the Pinecone index from the MongoDB collections.
